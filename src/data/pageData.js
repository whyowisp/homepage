        <p>
          I‚Äôm a software engineer based in Central Finland with experience
          primarily in fullstack development, focusing on React, C#/.NET, and
          Azure. I enjoy thinking, designing, and building effective solutions
          for the problems at hand. For me, software development is about those
          ‚Äúa-ha‚Äù moments ‚Äî watching pieces come together step by step into a
          working feature or product.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I‚Äôm technical, I also deeply care about people and the
          environment. Software is not just a marvel of technology but a tool
          that helps people accomplish real goals. That‚Äôs why simplicity,
          usability, and responsible development practices are essential to me.
          I actively but responsibly utilize modern AI-assisted development
          tools ü§ñ to improve my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm known for my no-nonsense attitude, eagerness to learn, and ability
          to adapt quickly. Ready to join a team and contribute to new
          challenges with a fresh perspective.
        </p>
        {/*<p>
          Hello, I am a freshly graduated software engineer currently located in
          Central-Finland, most experience in full stack development but with
          interest in basically anything that involves process of thinking,
          designing and building best solution for the problem in hand. In
          software development I simply enjoy for the a-ha moments and seeing
          bits and pieces coming together one by one towards a fully working
          feature or a product.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I could be considered as technical person, the truth is that I
          care also about people (and environmental issues also). In my
          philosophy the product is not only a gadget of marvel, but it acts as
          a tool or interface for another human to accomplish something. This
          means that in every phase simplicity and usability must be taken in
          account. Not to a surprise, colleagues are humans also, so being
          friendly and respectful while staying humble are in my core values.
        </p>
        <p>
          What comes down to tech and programming languages in short, I am a
          React developer peppered with some C#/.NET knowledge and who
          understands something about databases. Node.JS I can do too.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my free time I find myself usually spending time with my family or
          doing chores. All kind of games are on my list of interest and
          actually I oversee <em>a tabletop roleplaying related web-app</em>{' '}
          which I have created (with React/Node.JS/MongoDB). Occasionally I
          might write an adventure and be a game master for my friends. As it is
          in fashion nowadays, i also hit to the gym when in need for self care.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what might future hold for me? So far i have only scratched the
          surface of the industry. Now I am able to create a web-service from
          scratch, but for the scratch there is always an itch. And for me the
          itch is probably the lower level code with some modern and performant
          programming language (Just say it Mikko, it's <em>Rust</em>) and the
          wonders that could be done with it. Could it be games or simulations,
          maybe embedded? I cannot know. Another interesting path could be
          studying a little bit more to become as an IoT systems specialized SW
          architect.

        <p>
          Yes, I‚Äôm a millennial who grew up without mobile phones or the
          internet ‚Äî something I actually appreciate and could get quite
          nostalgic about. But today, my nostalgia is reserved for one special
          thing: the used Commodore 64 my father brought home for me when I was
          around eight years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside that cardboard box was a fascinating machine, accompanied by a
          couple of programming books on BASIC and a few game cassettes. I
          didn‚Äôt immediately dive into coding ‚Äî I played games too ‚Äî but those
          books quickly caught my attention with their intriguing content.
        </p>
        <b>
          10 FOR I = 1 TO 5 <br></br>
          20 PRINT "HELLO, WORLD!"<br></br>

          40 END<br></br>
        </b>
        <p>
          And there were longer programs too, sometimes hundreds of lines long.
          Naturally, I tried to type these programs exactly as they were, but my
          understanding was limited and Finnish was my only language at the
          time. So, unsurprisingly, those projects didn't quite work out.
          Instead, I started writing my own shorter programs, experimenting with
          PRINT statements, FOR loops, and GOTO commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          This early experience planted the seed for my enduring interest in
          computer science.

        this exercise was a Diary App for alpha males. It is a true fullstack
        project from MySQL database to backend implementation trough server-side
        rendering to web page design. On the other hand the Drawing Tab is
        implemented with vanilla JS, so there we have some client side rendering
        also.

        assistance of gravitational pull from a black hole but be careful not to
        get sucked in. Also Laika could be launched too far and he would be lost
        forever in the vastness of space. Player can nudge his path little bit
        by assistance of his rocket engine. Player get's scores from successful
        landings and highscore will be saved until next playsession.

        Especially when I was younger my life revolved around music. I used to

        where I graduated at 2005. Still, music is my passion, but nowadays
        mostly by listening to it.

        I have always been on two wheels, since I asked my parents to take off
        the auxiliary wheels as a four year old. My family never could afford
        new bicycle but nevertheless I kept going out and adventures. Later my
        body developed allergies and asthma, and i never could'nt get in good
        shape so please don't ask me how much I have cycled this year. My miles
        are not mentionworthy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead I enhanced my skills as a mechanic and made it my craft for few
        years. Still, work isn't necessarily easy with my health (nor anyones
        health in Finland where bikes collect quite a lot of dirt and basically
        bike mechanics have to breathe that stuff in when they are cleaning
        bikes) and eventually I had to quit. <br></br>
        That red coloured steel frame Basso in the images have been my main
        apparatus since 2018. I take her out few times in a year. Most of the
        time I commute either with my electric bike or with another steel framed
        old mountainbike. <br></br>I have been dreaming to get back to the
        singletracks, like serious mountain biking, which I used to do when I
        was younger. I enjoy marathon/xc types of rides and bikes, but I also
        love to have pace, maybe I dould try some enduro/all mountain type of
        riding too.
        <br></br>Oh, I almost forgot to mention I did bikepacking from Vantaa,
        to Joensuu at my twenties. Loved that stuff too; you know, for me it's
        always cycling and bikes, bikes and cycling.
